Transcriptomic and morphophysiological evidence for a specialized human cortical
GABAergic cell type 

Boldog et al.,2018

We describe convergent evidence from transcriptomics, morphology and physiology for a
specialized GABAergic neuron subtype in human cortex. Using unbiased single nucleus RNA
sequencing, we identify ten GABAergic interneuron subtypes with combinatorial gene
signatures in human cortical layer 1 and characterize a novel group of human interneurons with
anatomical features never described in rodents having large, “rosehip”-like axonal boutons and
compact arborization. These rosehip cells show an immunohistochemical profile (GAD1/CCKpositive,
CNR1/SST/CALB2/PVALB-negative) matching a single transcriptomically-defined cell
type whose molecular signature is not seen in mouse cortex. Rosehip cells make homotypic gap
junctions, predominantly target apical dendritic shafts of layer 3 pyramidal neurons and inhibit
backpropagating pyramidal action potentials in microdomains of the dendritic tuft. These cells
are therefore positioned for potent local control of distal dendritic computation in cortical
pyramidal neurons.
